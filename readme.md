### Testcases and assumptions to ensure routine works according to requirement

1. Assumed that the given amounts will be valid numeric data (but no more than that) and that the dates will be valid dates (but no more than that).
2. Assumed that final amount will be result of addition of initial amount and adjustment
3. Test cases should cover two scenarios one for validation of date and another is final code evaluation based on amount.
4. if assumption 1 is not valid then I would need to add test cases for valid date and amount format as well.
